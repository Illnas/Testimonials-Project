Testimonials Project


So holidays finally are over and I am back coding things. This time I did read what I need to do with this project and I did make object
constructor. It was not that hard making constructor as much as it was understanding what the point of it is! And, to be honest, I am 
still not sure what it actually does! All I need is that it reminds me of JSON. Gonna have to make sure to go over more tutorials 
regarding object constructors!

Off to next project!
